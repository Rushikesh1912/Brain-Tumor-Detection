# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN with Grad-CAM GUI

This project is an AI-based medical image classification system that detects four types of brain tumors from MRI images using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system features a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** and includes **Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations**, detailed disease explanations, and **downloadable PDF medical reports**.
